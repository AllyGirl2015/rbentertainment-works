Organization Policies
🛡️ RBEW Policies & Standards
Welcome to the foundation of how we operate.

Reality Builders Entertainment Works (RBEW) is committed to ethical creativity, mutual respect, and human-centered development. The policies below define how we treat content, protect our contributors, handle difficult situations, and ensure a space that values individuality without exploitation.

These are the values we stand on — for creators, by creators.


✍️ C.O.P. – Copyright & Ownership Policy
RBEW supports the creative rights of every contributor. We believe in ethical collaboration — not creative theft, exploitation, or silence.

You own what you create. All contributors retain the rights to their respective work. RBEW does not claim sole ownership unless a separate agreement is made.


Removal rights are respected. If you ask for your content to be removed from a project, RBEW will make strong efforts to do so at the safest possible time to avoid disruption or harm to others involved.


You will be credited. Every meaningful contribution will be properly attributed, unless anonymity is requested.


You will be fairly compensated. In the event of project monetization, contributors will receive a percentage appropriate to the size and impact of their input.


Plagiarism is not tolerated. Any stolen, uncredited, or dishonestly claimed work will result in removal from the project and public disassociation from the offending material.



🤖 A.E.P. – AI Exception Policy
AI can be a tool — but it cannot replace genuine creativity.

AI-generated content is not accepted as sole creative work unless:


It is clearly labeled as AI-generated


It is not passed off as original human work


Credit is given to the AI tool used (e.g., ChatGPT, MidJourney, etc.)


AI content is not protected under C.O.P. Any AI-assisted material cannot be claimed as owned unless it’s paired with a human-made creative layer (e.g., voice acting, editing, interpretation).


RBEW does not accept copyright claims based solely on AI output.



🧠 M.H.P. – Mental Health Policy
We prioritize the well-being of every contributor. We know that creativity doesn’t happen in a vacuum — and that mental health matters.

VML – Voluntary Mental Health Leave is allowed at any time.
If you’re struggling, overwhelmed, or need space, you can step back for the rest of the day (minimum) with no judgment.


Extended Leave Recommendations:
If your teammates notice you’re struggling, they may recommend a 1–2 day mental health break. This is never a punishment — it’s support. Refusing is okay, unless disruptive behavior continues.


Return When Ready:
If you take leave by your own request, you can return anytime after the minimum rest period, when you feel well enough.


Escalation Clause:
If a pattern of harmful behavior persists, we may ask for deeper review, longer leave, or additional action — but with empathy, not punishment.



🏳️‍🌈 N.D.P. – Non-Discrimination Policy
RBEW is an inclusive space. No one will be treated unfairly or excluded for who they are — only for how they act.

Protected Traits:
We do not tolerate discrimination based on:


Gender identity


Sexual orientation


Race or ethnicity


Disability or neurodiversity


Religion or cultural background


Mutual Respect:
Identity should never be used as a weapon in arguments, power struggles, or superiority claims. Disrespect from any side will be addressed fairly.


Conflict Resolution:
If a conflict arises involving a protected trait, we will:


Investigate both sides


Protect those targeted


Address misuse of identity if weaponized inappropriately


Apply fair, case-by-case corrective action


RBEW is not a space where diversity is tolerated — it is celebrated, as long as it is paired with respect.


💬 Internal Conduct & Privacy
All active contributors are required to sign a lightweight NDA covering confidential materials, unreleased works, and team discussions.


You may discuss projects with trusted friends or family, as long as it does not lead to leaks, reposting, or derivative projects.



📌 Final Words
These policies aren’t just paperwork — they are guidelines for trust.
We are not corporate. We are not mechanical. We are a builder's network — creative, human, and rooted in values.

By joining or supporting RBEW, you are choosing a space that respects people first, and ideas deeply.

We’re proud of that.
