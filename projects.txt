🟩 FrameState RP (Minecraft Framework)
Discord: https://discord.gg/H8VderVNzc
Status: Framework and world under early development


Description:
FrameState RP is not just a Minecraft RP server — it’s the foundation of an entire roleplay development platform. Inspired by the modular power of FiveM, FrameState is being built as a developer-friendly RP framework that gives players, storytellers, and coders full control over creating deeply immersive, realistic, or fantastical Minecraft-based roleplay worlds.

Designed for Minecraft Bedrock Edition, FrameState focuses on maximum compatibility, easy distribution, and creative depth — all with minimal external mod dependencies. It will eventually ship as a standalone installable framework with core systems, sample maps, and scripts, allowing others to build and host their own FrameState-powered servers.

From city governance and economics to superpower systems and voice-based immersion, FrameState RP is about creating Minecraft worlds with purpose, realism, and storytelling at their core.


Core Vision & Goals:
✅ Build a full RP engine inside Minecraft — inspired by FiveM but tailored for block-based creativity
✅ Develop a customizable, redistributable framework that others can install, run, and expand
✅ Maintain vanilla compatibility to keep it accessible for console and mobile players
✅ Blend real-world systems (jobs, laws, infrastructure) with creative fiction (powers, multiverses, secret factions)
✅ Provide dev tools and hooks for future communities to build their own FrameState RP networks


Planned Features:
🧱 Framework Capabilities

Installable core files with scripted systems and visual asset support


Custom folders for jobs, districts, powers, events, factions, and vehicles


Developer hooks for creating quests, player data tracking, city progression, and more


Support for both online multiplayer and LAN/singleplayer usage


🌍 World Building (Default Map)

Realistic city layout with zones for crime, commerce, housing, and schooling


Planned schools like UA Academy, tech labs, and heroic institutions


Metro and air traffic systems, power grids, and disaster frameworks in development


🏛 Role & Power Systems

Default RP career tree: police, EMT, delivery, government, education, and black-market roles


Randomized power assignment system (quirk-style) with player-driven evolution


Tech-based, supernatural, and legacy-based paths for “non-powered” characters


Optional restrictions and cooldowns to encourage RP over chaos


🔊 Voice Integration (via Discord)

Discord bot-powered voice chat systems for proximity, radio, calls, and broadcast


Support for “phone emulation,” faction channels, and secure lines


🔧 Custom Engine Logic (Coming Soon)

Configurable crime/law/penal code system with automated penalties


Dynamic weather and disaster response integration


Real-time economy engine with inflation, demand, and tax simulation



🔗 Current Status:
🧪 Framework: Core code in concept and file architecture planning
🗺️ World: Spawn in development, default city layout being blocked out
🛠️ Discord: Early-stage coordination and discussion
💡 Community Dev Access: Coming soon via Discord


💬 Final Notes:
FrameState RP is about giving creators tools — not walls.
Whether you're a solo storyteller, a server founder, or a school RP admin — FrameState will eventually let you install a working, expandable RP universe into any Bedrock Minecraft world.

Time Police Department (TPD) – Show Series
🕒 Time Police Department (TPD)
Logo Meaning: The badge of the Time Police is a clock — its hands forever fixed to the moment of first activation. The small green block? A hidden timestamp, referencing the first chronal recording in TPD lore… and Alissa’s very first YouTube upload.


Description:
Time Police Department (TPD) is a multiverse-spanning sci-fi epic built around a single impossible mission: protecting the timeline from itself. Combining the existential weight of Detroit: Become Human with the mind-bending twists of Doctor Who and Loki, TPD follows a tactical organization that monitors reality’s fractures — and the unstable beings who try to break it.

Each episode weaves personal struggle, paradox law, and high-stakes investigation, following field agents assigned to correct anomalies across diverging realities. But some timelines fight back. And some truths… weren’t meant to be remembered.


Core Themes:
Temporal ethics — What does it mean to "fix" a timeline?


Identity conflict — Who are you when your history is overwritten?


Multiversal balance — Which worlds deserve to survive?


Power vs accountability — What happens when the keepers of time become its greatest threat?



Project Format:
✅ Full-screen show series concept — with cinematic ambitions and multiple seasons planned
✅ Pilot written and scripted (Season 1, Episode 1 complete)
✅ Future companion novel adaptation in planning
✅ Central to the Grand Existence universe, connecting to other timelines like Virtual Guardians and The Pendant Legacy


Planned Features:
🕵️‍♂️ Characters & Divisions

Agents like Jean A-2015 and Jean A-143 — reflections of morality across diverging fates


TPD is split into units (Field, Observation, Reset, Blackout) each with unique duties and protocols


Time travel tech includes anchor watches, temporal seals, and paradox engines


⌛ Chrono Law & Universe Structure

The Prime Directive of Time: no timeline may be corrected for personal gain


Temporal crimes are categorized from Class-1 to Blackout Events


Paradox offenders may be wiped, sealed in chronal cells, or… recruited


🌌 Narrative Format

Each episode focuses on a new temporal threat — weaving in season-long arcs


Background threads explore TPD's possible corruption, rogue agents, and forgotten histories




🔗 Current Status:
📝 Pilot script completed
🧩 Season roadmap in active outlining
🎨 Concept art and visual assets in production
📚 Tie-in lore integration with other Grand Existence projects under way


🕯️ Final Note:
You can’t save every timeline… but some will never forgive you for trying.

Time bends. Choices echo. And the Time Police are all that stands between chaos… and everything else.
